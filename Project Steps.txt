Step 1: Data Download and Exploration
Download Data Processed Data:
- Access the processed RNA-seq data from GEO with ID GSE53697 [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53697).

Download Metadata:
- Download the series matrix file for metadata.

Download Raw Data:
For Raw Data: Use the SRA Toolkit to download the raw sequencing data from the SRA database.

Commands:
chmod +x download_data.sh
./download_data.sh





Step 2: Upstream Analysis
- This is to process raw data
1. Quality Control:
Assess the quality of raw reads using tools like FastQC.
```bash
fastqc your_file.fastq
```

2. Trimming and Filtering:
- If needed, perform trimming and filtering of low-quality bases using tools like Trimmomatic or Cutadapt.
```bash
trimmomatic SE -phred33 input.fastq output.fastq LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36
```

3. Sequence Alignment and Quantification

3.1. Align Reads:
- Use an alignment tool such as HISAT2 or STAR to align the trimmed reads to the reference genome.
```bash
hisat2 -x genome_index -U input.fastq -S output.sam
```

3.2. Convert to BAM:
- Convert the SAM file to BAM format using tools like Samtools.
```bash
samtools view -bS input.sam > output.bam
```

3.3. Quantify Gene Expression:
- Use tools like featureCounts or HTSeq to quantify gene expression.
```bash
featureCounts -a annotation.gtf -o counts.txt input.bam
```

Step 3: Downstream Analysis
Here we can use either the downloaded processed data or the results from downstream analysis.

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Explore Metadata:
- Review the metadata to understand sample characteristics, experimental conditions, and any other relevant information.

Load Data:
- Import the RNA-seq data into your preferred analysis environment (e.g., Python with pandas, R).

Data Cleaning:
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Ensure data integrity and consistency.

Data Transformation:
- If necessary, transform the data (e.g., log transformation) to meet assumptions of downstream analyses.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
PCA Analysis:
- Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore the overall structure of the data.
- Visualize PCA results to observe any clustering or separation between control and advanced AD samples.

3. Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Differential Expression Analysis:
- Perform differential gene expression analysis to identify genes significantly different between control and advanced AD samples.
- Utilize tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, or limma.

Visualization:
Create volcano plots or heatmaps to visualize the differentially expressed genes.

4. Pathway Analysis
Gene Enrichment Analysis:
- Conduct gene enrichment analysis to identify pathways associated with differentially expressed genes.
- Use tools like DAVID, Enrichr, or clusterProfiler.

GSEA Analysis:
- Perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to further validate pathway enrichment findings.

5. Interpretation and Reporting

Interpret Results:
- Summarize key findings and interpret the biological significance of identified pathways.

Visualization:
- Create visualizations (e.g., pathway diagrams) to enhance the understanding of altered pathways in advanced AD.

Documentation:
- Document the analysis workflow, parameters used, and any assumptions made.

6. Additional Analyses (if needed)

Subgroup Analysis:
- Explore potential subgroup differences within the advanced AD samples.

Integration with External Data:
- Integrate findings with relevant external datasets for validation.

7. Conclusion and Discussion
Conclusion:
- Summarize the project's main findings and their implications.

Discussion:
- Discuss limitations, future directions, and any recommendations for further research.
